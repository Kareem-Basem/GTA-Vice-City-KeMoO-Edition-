üéÆ How to Create Your Own GTA: Vice City Mods
Welcome to the GTA: Vice City Modding Guide! This guide is based on my experience creating the KeMoO Edition, where I enhanced graphics, vehicles, weapons, audio, and gameplay with tools like CLEO and custom scripts. Here, I‚Äôll walk you through the steps to create your own mods, even if you‚Äôre a beginner.

Why Mod GTA: Vice City?
Modding lets you personalize Vice City, from improving visuals to adding new vehicles or enhancing gameplay with scripts. It‚Äôs a great way to refresh a classic game while learning new skills!

Step 1: Prepare Your Tools üõ†Ô∏è
You‚Äôll need the following tools to start modding:

IMG Tool: A simple tool for editing .img files in Vice City (e.g., gta3.img for vehicles and models). Download it from GTA modding sites like GTAInside.
TXD Workshop: For editing textures (.txd files). Search for it on GTA modding forums like GTAForums.
Photoshop or GIMP: For creating or editing textures. GIMP is a free alternative to Photoshop (download from gimp.org).
WinRAR: For extracting and managing mod files. Download from win-rar.com.
CLEO Mod: For adding custom scripts (e.g., free camera). Download from cleo.li.
Modloader: For easy mod management. Available on GTA modding sites.

Setup Tips:

Backup Your Game: Before modding, copy your GTA: Vice City game folder to a safe location to avoid losing the original files.
Run as Administrator: Run IMG Tool, CLEO, and other tools as Administrator to avoid permission issues.


Step 2: Modifying Textures (Graphics) üñºÔ∏è
Textures control how everything looks in the game‚Äîcharacters, buildings, vehicles, etc. Let‚Äôs start with a simple example: changing the main character‚Äôs outfit.
Example: Change Tommy Vercetti‚Äôs Shirt

Locate the Texture File:

Open IMG Tool and navigate to your GTA: Vice City folder.
Go to models/ and open gta3.img.
Find player.txd (this file contains Tommy‚Äôs textures) and extract it to your desktop (Commands > Extract).


Edit the Texture:

Open player.txd in TXD Workshop.
Look for a texture named something like player_torso (Tommy‚Äôs shirt).
Export the texture as a .bmp or .png file.
Open the exported texture in Photoshop/GIMP.
Edit the texture (e.g., change the shirt color to red or add a custom design).
Save the edited texture as a .bmp or .png.


Import the New Texture:

In TXD Workshop, import your edited texture back into player.txd by replacing the original player_torso.
Save the file.
In IMG Tool, go to gta3.img, delete the old player.txd (Commands > Delete), and add the modified player.txd (Commands > Add).


Test In-Game:

Launch GTA: Vice City and check if Tommy‚Äôs shirt has updated. If not, ensure you saved the files correctly and are running the game as Administrator.



Pro Tip:
For better lighting (like I did with Ocean View Hotel in KeMoO Edition), adjust the brightness and contrast of building textures in Photoshop/GIMP. For example, increase brightness for neon effects at night.

Step 3: Replacing Vehicles üöó
Vehicles are a great way to refresh Vice City‚Äôs 1980s vibe. Let‚Äôs replace a car with a new model.
Example: Replace the Cheetah with a Custom 1980s Car

Find a Vehicle Model:

Search for free Vice City-compatible vehicle models on sites like GTA5-Mods or GTAInside.
Look for a 1980s-style car (e.g., a Ferrari Testarossa). Download the model‚Äîit usually includes two files: .dff (model) and .txd (texture).


Replace the Vehicle:

Open IMG Tool and go to models/gta3.img.
Find cheetah.dff and cheetah.txd (these are the Cheetah‚Äôs files).
Extract both files as a backup (Commands > Extract).
Delete the old cheetah.dff and cheetah.txd (Commands > Delete).
Add the new .dff and .txd files you downloaded (Commands > Add).
Save the changes (Commands > Rebuild Archive).


Test In-Game:

Launch the game and find a Cheetah (it spawns near Ocean Beach).
Check if the new model appears correctly. If there are issues (e.g., missing textures), ensure the .txd file matches the .dff file.



Pro Tip:
To match the 1980s vibe (like in KeMoO Edition), choose cars with retro designs and vibrant colors. Test the vehicle‚Äôs handling in-game to ensure it drives smoothly.

Step 4: Basic Audio Modding üîä
Audio mods can enhance the game‚Äôs atmosphere. Let‚Äôs replace a radio station‚Äôs music.
Example: Add a New Song to Flash FM

Locate the Audio Files:

Navigate to audio/ in your GTA: Vice City folder.
Find the FLASH folder (this is for Flash FM radio).
Copy one of the .adf files (e.g., flash_01.adf) as a backup.


Prepare Your Song:

Find a 1980s song (e.g., a WAV file of "Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson).
Convert the song to the correct format using a tool like GTA Audio Editor (search for it online).
The output should be an .adf file compatible with Vice City.


Replace the Song:

Replace the original flash_01.adf in the FLASH folder with your new .adf file.


Test In-Game:

Start the game, get in a car, and switch to Flash FM.
Check if your new song plays. If not, ensure the .adf file is correctly formatted.



Pro Tip:
For a more immersive experience (like in KeMoO Edition), choose songs that fit the 1980s vibe. Also, adjust environmental sounds (e.g., ocean waves near Ocean Beach) for better realism.

Step 5: Using CLEO Mods (Advanced) üéÆ
CLEO Mods allow you to add custom scripts to enhance gameplay. Based on my KeMoO Edition experience, here‚Äôs how to start:
Example: Add a Free Camera

Install CLEO:
Download CLEO for Vice City from cleo.li and place the CLEO folder in your game directory.


Add a Script:
Copy a script like FreeCam.cs (available on modding forums) into the CLEO folder.


Test In-Game:
Launch the game and press the assigned key (check the script‚Äôs readme) to activate the free camera.



Pro Tip:

Use scripts like 60cframelimiter.cs to control frame rates for smoother gameplay.
Test scripts one by one to avoid conflicts.
Enhance visuals with .asi scripts (e.g., ParticleEx.asi for better particle effects).


Step 6: Test and Optimize ‚öôÔ∏è
Modding can be tricky, so always test your changes:

Test After Each Change: Launch the game after every modification to catch issues early.
Update Graphics Drivers: Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date for better performance.
Check Compatibility: Some mods may not work together‚Äîtest combinations carefully.
Use the "tricks" Folder: Check the game‚Äôs tricks folder (if available) for additional tweaks and fixes.


Additional Resources üìö

Free Textures: Download high-quality textures from textures.com (check usage rights).
Vehicle Models: Find Vice City-compatible models on GTAInside.

Final Tips

Start Small: Begin with simple mods (like changing a texture) before tackling bigger changes.
Respect Rights: Always use assets you have permission to use, and credit creators if required.
Join the Community: Share your mods on GTAForums or other communities to get feedback and learn more.
